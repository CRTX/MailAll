# MailAll World of Warcraft Addon

I created this addon because I was not able to send all the items from my bags to another character without having to click on items forever.

With this addon you're able to send all your items to another character or other characters you own.

Command Syntax: /maillall [username] [mail subject] [mail message]

Examples:
 - /mailall Thorrbo Items! Yay.
 - /maillall Thorrbo Armor Remind myself to disenchant these
